PL/XSLT Installation Instructions
=================================

You need to have PostgreSQL 7.4 or later, and you need to have the
server include files installed.

To build and install PL/XSLT, use this procedure:

./configure --prefix=YOUR_CHOICE
make
make install

The include files are found using the pg_config program that is
included in the PostgreSQL installation.  To use a different
PostgreSQL installation, point configure to a different pg_config like
so:

./configure ... PG_CONFIG=/else/where/pg_config

Note that generally server-side modules such as this one have to be
recompiled for every major PostgreSQL version (that is, 7.4, 8.0,
...).

To declare the language in a database, use

psql -d DBNAME -f PREFIX/share/plxslt/createlang_xslt.sql

with a server running.  To drop it, use "droplang xslt".

If you checked out the source code from Git, run "autoreconf -i" first
to set up the build infrastructure.
