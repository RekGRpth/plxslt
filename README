PL/XSLT Procedural Language Handler for PostgreSQL
==================================================

PL/XSLT is a procedural language handler for PostgreSQL that allows you
to write stored procedures in XSLT.  A function definition looks like:

CREATE FUNCTION foo(xml) RETURNS xml AS $$
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  ...
</xsl:stylesheet>
$$ LANGUAGE xslt;

Conditions on the function definition:

- The first parameter must be of type xml.  It will receive the input
  document.  Every function must have at least this one parameter.

- The following function parameters will be supplied to the stylesheet
  as XSL parameters.

- The return type must match the output method specified by the
  stylesheet.  If it is xml, then the return type must be xml; if it
  is text or html, the return type must be text or varchar.

- Triggers are not supported.

Refer to the INSTALL file for installation instructions and COPYING
for the license.  The distribution also contains test.sql which
contains a simplistic demonstration of the functionality.

I'm interested if anyone is using this.
